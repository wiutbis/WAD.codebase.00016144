Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (for both frontend and backend)
npm (Node package manager)
Git (to clone the repositories)
MongoDB (or other database if your backend requires it)
.NET Core (if your backend is built on .NET)
The project is divided into two main parts:

Frontend: This part handles the user interface and interacts with the backend via API calls.
Backend: This part serves as the API layer, handling requests and processing data.
Clone both the frontend and backend repositories from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WAD.FRONTEND.000.16144.git
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WAD.BACKEND.00016144.git
Navigate to the backend directory:
cd WAD.BACKEND.00016144
For a Node.js/Express backend, run:
npm install
For a .NET backend, you might need to run:
dotnet restore
Set up environment variables (if necessary):

Create a .env file in the backend project’s root directory (if not already provided).
Add necessary configurations (e.g., database URL, API keys).
Start the backend server:

For Node.js backend:
npm start
For .NET backend:
dotnet run
Set up the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory:
cd WAD.FRONTEND.00016144
Install frontend dependencies:

For Angular or React (adjust as needed for your frontend):
npm install
Start the frontend development server:

For Angular:
ng serve
Run Both Together
Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running on their respective ports.
The frontend will interact with the backend using the API (e.g., http://localhost:5000/api).
Database Setup (if applicable)
If your backend uses a database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL):

For MongoDB:

Make sure MongoDB is running on your local machine or connect to a remote instance.
Set the MongoDB URI in your .env file (for example, MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdb).
For other databases:

Follow the setup steps in the backend project’s documentation for configuring the database.
 Troubleshooting
Backend not connecting to the database? Double-check your .env file for the correct database URL.
Frontend not loading? Make sure the frontend development server is running and check for any errors in the browser's console.
API errors? Check the backend logs for more details on what might be causing the issue.
